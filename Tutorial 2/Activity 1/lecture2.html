            <h2>HTML and its history</h2>
            <p>HTML is defined as a markup language for creating websites. Initial implementation of HTML and HTTP between 1990 and 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau. HTML’s formal codification by the World Wide Web Consortium (better known as the W3C) between 1995 and 1997. While the XHTML 2.0 specification was being developed, a small group of developers at Opera and Mozilla formed the WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group). By 2009, the W3C stopped work on XHTML 2.0 and instead adopted the work done by WHATWG and named it HTML5.</p>

            <h2>HTML Syntax</h2>
            <p>HTML documents are composed of textual content and HTML elements. HTML element encompasses the element name within angle brackets called tag, HTML attribute that provide more information about the element and the content within the tag. Often an HTML element will contain other HTML elements. In such a case, the container element is said to be a parent of the contained, or child, element.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>HTML document should only focus on the structure of the document and should not describe the visual representation of the content. Links are created using the <a> element (the “a” stands for anchor). Inline elements do not disrupt the flow of the text. The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. HTML5 semantic structure elements: Header • Nav • Main • Section • Article • Figure • Figcaption • Aside • Footer</p>
