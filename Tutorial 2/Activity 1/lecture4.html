            <h2>Introduction to JavaScriptl</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is an object-oriented, dynamically typed scripting language. It can be used to programmatically access and dynamically manipulate any aspect of the HTML documents. It can be used to animate, move, transition, hide and load content into part of page without refresh. Environments and libraries like Node.js and React have extended JavaScript to server and to mobile application development. JavaScript was introduced by Netscape in their Navigator browser back in 1996. Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International in 1997, ECMAScript is simultaneously a superset and subset of the JavaScript programming language. </p>

            <h2>Arrays and Functions</h2>
            <p>Arrays are one of the most commonly used data structures in programming. Arrays in JavaScript are zero indexed. [] is the notation for accessing the elements in the array. .length gives the length of the array. Functions are the building block for modular code in JavaScript. JavaScript function declarations are hoisted to the beginning of their current level. Callback Functions is simply a function that is passed to another function.

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>In JavaScript, objects are a collection of named values which are called properties in JavaScript. JavaScript is a prototype-based language, in that new objects are created from already existing prototype objects. An object is represented by a list of key-value pairs with colons between the key and value, with commas separating key-value pairs. Another way to create an instance of an object is to use the Object constructor. JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is used as a languageindependent data interchange format analogous in use to XML. JSON is encountered frequently in contemporary web development. It is used by developers as part of their workflow, and many web applications receive JSON from other sources, like other programs or websites.</p>
